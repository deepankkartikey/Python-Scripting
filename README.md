This repository consists of multiple small python automation scripts that I created while learning Python!

#### List of Scripts available
- **[Downloads Sorter](./Automated-Downloads-Sorter/)** - Automatically sorts downloaded files into music, video, image, pdf documents, code files, etc.
- **[Youtube Video Downloader](yt-downloader.py)** - Downloads either a youtube video or a playlist based on type of URL that is passed as script parameter while running it.
