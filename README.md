This repository consists of multiple small python automation scripts that I created while learning Python!

### Getting Started
- Install (latest) Python version
- Run the following command in the parent directory to install Python dependecies needed to run the scripts:
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### List of Scripts available
- **[Downloads Sorter](./Automated-Downloads-Sorter/)** - Automatically sorts downloaded files into music, video, image, pdf documents, code files, etc.
- **[Youtube Video Downloader](yt-downloader.py)** - Downloads either a youtube video or a playlist based on type of URL that is passed as script parameter while running it.
- **[PDF-Merger](./PDF-Merger/)** - Merge two or more PDF files into one. When script is run, all pdf files in current directory are combined and a new combined file is generated.
